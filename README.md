# Hydro-LSTM
Towards Interpretable LSTM Modeling of Hydrological Systems

This repository is splited in 4 different sections.
  - Data
  - Codes
  - Results
  - Notebooks

### Getting started

To run the code you can use the provided conda environment. To clone the repo and create the environment use (the last step may take some time):
```
git clone git@github.com:ldelafue/Hydro-LSTM.git
cd Hydro-LSTM
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Once you have the environment set up you can activate it and start running the code. For example, you can try:
```
conda activate Hydro-LSTM
cd Codes
python main.py --code 9223000 --cells 1 --memory 256 --epochs 10 --model HYDRO
```

To see the available options, you can use:
```
python main.py -h, --help
```

### Data
This folder contains the three sources of data used in this paper (USGS, CAMELS attributes, CAMELS time series). That information is completely available in this repository, so you do not need to request or download information from another source.

By using the CAMELS attributes in your publication(s), you agree to cite:

By using the CAMELS time series in your publication(s), you agree to cite:

### Codes
This forlder has the 5 python code used in the training and evaluation (testing) of the results of the models.
  - main.py: This code is calling all the other files. This script has some parameterization such as gauge ID, #cells, #memory (days), learning rate, #epochs, and the model used (LSTM or HYDRO)
  - LSTM.py and Hydro_LSTM.py: They create a class with the specific structure. Its equation can be found in this script.
  - importing.py: This script create the dataset with the data from the thre sources.
  - utils.py: This script has some specific functions used to create the datset and train the model.

Moreover, the folder has the Anaconda environment used to run the codes, and a txt file with an example about how to run the main.py script using comand lines in a terminal.

### Results
This folder has the summary results for each structure used. Hydro and LSTM refers to the experiment with 10 catchments. Hydro_CONUS refers to the experiment with 587 catchment using Hydro_LSTM. In the cases where the weight distribution is analyzed, The folder has the actual model saved in a pkl file .

### Notebooks
This folder has the files used to create each of the figures presented in the paper. All the figures are contained in the jupiter notebook Figures.ipynb.
